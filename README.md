This is my second assignment for Interactive Development Module.
For this assignment, I created an application that can tell the user up to 10 of the closest points of interests. (Based on inputs from the user)

## Design Process
- The application was created for users who want to know where the nearest places to them are, so my goal was to help them find it, based on their inputs.


- As the creator, I wanted to create an application that would allow a user to find the closest Point of Interest based on their inputs.
- As the user, I would want to know where are the nearest places to me, hence I would use this application.

## Features
- The home page is nothing too special, just a responsive image, the applications name below it, and a short description of the application below that. 
- The nearpoi page is where the form is. The form will take in user inputs, which will then be passed through two different API's. Finally, the results are shown in the same page.


## Technologies Used
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to simplify the creation of the website

- [OneMapAPI](https://docs.onemap.sg/)
    - The two API's I used were taken from **OneMap**. I used their Search API and Reverse Geocode API.

## Testing

### Bugs and problems
- The OneMapSingapore API uses a free access token. However, the token is only valid for 3 days, so a new token would have to be generated by the time this assignment is submitted. The token that is currently inside the code is valid until 11 January (The token is denoted by "token="). After that, a new token can be generated following the instructions in this website: https://discuss.onemap.sg/t/steps-for-api-authentication/59

- A Maximum of 500m buffer/radius applies for buildings and 20m buffer/radius for roads.

- Longer response time is expected for searching of addresses within a buffer/radius range. The API will return a maximum of 10 nearest buildings.

- The API has a maximum of 250 calls per minute

- For the search API, each page of json response is restricted to a maximum of 10 results. So far, I have tested it five times using the actual API. I'm not sure if this means you can only call it 5 more times but I will include a screenshot of the finished product, as well as a video of it working.

On a webpage, the website is fine, and it does not look too clustered.
On the phone, the website is able to show the page without it looking too weird.

### Content
- The code for the error placement seen in script.js from line 12 to 19 was copied from https://plnkr.co/edit/6xYi4kUeRFoKAdRywff4?p=preview&preview

### Media
- The near-me-icon.jpg was created by me using photoshop. The photos I used were taken from https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/google-map-maker-launches-singapore/ and https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/23/75512/quantum-radar-has-been-demonstrated-for-the-first-time/ 

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from Google. This is because Google also has a similar feature which tells the user the nearest locations to them.
